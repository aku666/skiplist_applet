What is this?
-------------
This is a skip list applet which I wrote for an Algorithms class. It is
designed to be a teaching tool to help people understand the concept of
skip lists and how they work.

How to install?
---------------
Installation of this is pretty simple. Just copy all of the class files
to the directory on your webserver that you would like them to be
available from. Then copy the skip_list_tool.html file to that directory
as well. Then just provide a link on your website to the
skip_list_tool.html file and all should be working. Note: The users of
course will have to have a working java plugin setup in their browser of
choice.
